  <ul>
    <li><p>The DOOM (2016) gameplay is a very fast and aggressive game with the idea of constant offense and movement to kill the demons but stay alive as well.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The only times when the player gets to rest is when the Slayer kills all of the demons â€” which will almost never happen because they are everywhere and keep coming back.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Key parts of this aggression cycle include the fact that whenever an enemy is staggered, Glory Kills are available which can replenish health by killing the demon in a very brutal way.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Using a Chainsaw against the demons will also replenish all ammunition so that the cycle of killing never gets interrupted and the player can focus on the demon killing.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The player is also given buffs to their suit and weapons if they complete a certain task of killing demons in a certain way using different weapons.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A quick Arsenal swap allows for some brutal combos and finishes to maximize the experience of fast, aggressive and constant offense. This revolutionized the gaming industry in such a way for a game to not only be fun but fluid, satisfying and aggressive all in one.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The Multiplayer feature allows for some insane clips and combos which make the game that much more fun by allowing players to test out their demon killing skills on other players who love demon killing as well.</p></li>
